# **What is this**
The aim of the project is to visualize the process of the weakest precondition's computing

### Where is it working
Environment is a browser

### What was used
There is being used React framework, JavaScript

### Work process
You enter a program in TEL programming language and a postcondition for the program, after that press button, and you will see
first step of computing of the weakest precondition using special notation, to proceed process of computing choose appropriate
block of 'wp[Index]' and click that, you will see next step, when a precondition computing for a block is completed, there is a
button '=Substitute all wp[Index]=', when it is pressed, you can see how all occurrences of current block will be replaced with
computed precondition for the 'wp[Index]' block
